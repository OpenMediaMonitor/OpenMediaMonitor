# OpenMediaMonitor
An open-source media monitor. 

It is at the moment in its early infancy. I.e. at the moment basically no functionality is implemented. 


## Short-term goals

At the moment the focus is to be able to discover rss/atom feeds of a website and then add these feeds to the OpenMediaMonitors list of feeds.

A processing pipeline should be able to extract the articles (removal of HTML boilerplate), tokenize and tag the tokens with their Part of Speech tags (postag). This should be used to extract direct and optimally also indirect quotes from the texts.
